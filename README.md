# Duplicate requests from Jersey Client

This program reproduces a problem that we've seen with Jersey Client, in which it will duplicate some requests.

*N.b. I haven't found the root cause yet, but it seems to happen if:*

1. *We make both PUT and GET requests*
2. *Fail to close the GET requests response*

## Notes

- It is not enough to ignore the PUT response, it seems to require a different endpoint
- It happens occationally with a single threaded client loop â€“ but the ExecutorService makes it much more frequent
- `org/glassfish/jersey/client/HttpUrlConnectorProvider.java:278` does NOT call into `return (HttpURLConnection) url.openConnection()` more than once, so the duplicate seems to happen in HttpURLConnection

*N.b. This will also cause duplicate requests, which suggests that it isn't the Jersey Client that is at fault...*

```
            es.submit(() -> {
                try {
                    URL url = new URL(String.format("%s?id=%s", BASE_URI, id));

                    HttpURLConnection con = (HttpURLConnection) url.openConnection();
                    con.setRequestMethod("PUT");
                    con.setDoOutput(true);
                    InputStream is = con.getInputStream();
                    is.close();
                } catch (IOException e) {
                }
            });
            es.submit(() -> {
                try {
                    URL url = new URL(BASE_URI);
                    HttpURLConnection con = (HttpURLConnection) url.openConnection();
                    InputStream is = con.getInputStream();

                    // This prevents the duplicate requests.
                    // is.close();
                } catch (IOException e) {
                }
            });
```
